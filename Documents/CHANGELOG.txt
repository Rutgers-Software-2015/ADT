	  universal template, design and functionality from the first
	  Demo.

RAHUL:
	- I have edited the KitchenStaff GUI to match the template. It has the same functionality as the DEMO 1.

DAVID:
	- Recreated Host Interface to accomodate variable waiters
	- Host Interface now contains (everything functional):
		> A way to assign a waiters from a list of waiters to a table from a list 
		  of tables
			>> To assign a waiter to a table:
				1. Select Table from the table dropdown menu
				2. Select Waiter from the waiter dropdown menu
				3. Select "Assign Waiter"
				*Note: If a waiter already exists at a table, a popup will 
				       come up stating that a waiter has already been 
				       assigned to a table
			>> To unassign a waiter from a table:
				1. Select Table from the table dropdown menu
				2. Select Waiter from the waiter dropdown menu
				3. Select "Unassign Waiter"
		> A way to view currently assigned waiters to a table
			>> To view currently assigned waiters to a table:

				3. Select dropdown menu, and observe waiters assigned to 
				   table
		> An indicator showing if waiters are assigned to the table
			>> Indicator is at the table arrangement "map" to the right of a 
			   particular table. 
				>>> Green indicator: Waiter(s) occupy table
				>>> Red indicator: No waiter(s) occupy table
		> Added way to prevent assigning customer to a table that has customers 
	          already assigned to it, and unassigning customers from a table that 
		  already has customers at it (popup will come up showing error)
	
HARSH:
	- UPDATE 1
	
RYAN:
	- Added better interface between the text fields and the JTable. 
	- When you click or select a row in the JTable, the data generates in the corresponding
	- textfields in the Menu and Inventory windows. 
	- The goal behind this was to reduce the amount of typing between the user and the program.
	- This in turn reduces the amount of typing needed to edit items.
	- This also allows for easy item additions if there needs to be a new item added that 
	- is similar to one of the menu.
	
ROB:
	- Help button has been added, and any buttons not implemented yet, display a message.
	- Font is bigger, and more easily visible.
	- Currently reads menu via communicator, pushing tables WIP

RAHUL:
	- Made only one scroll view for the orders. 
	- Now can select the row for which item is ready.
	- Now the buttons for emergency has confirmation and message string input once it is clicked.
	- The send message asks for the message and the employee id.
	- The help button is now implemented.
	- NOTES:
		- The orders appear only on first initialization till the database is fully established
		- The communicator must be established before the send messages work.

SAM:
	- Completed NotificationGUI, now available for addition to GUIs
		- No functionality just yet, but it is coming soon
	- Added getConnectionStatus() function to Database Communicator to assist with connection checking
	- Added a 15 second timer to the Database Communicator. This timer will call getConnectionStatus() every 15 seconds. If the connection status is not 0, it will attempt to reconnect. Doing this will automatically handle sporadic disconnections
	- Add clearBackground() function to GradientPanel to make it completely transparent. This was done by overriding the paintComponent
	
DAVID:
	- UPDATE 1
	
HARSH:
	- UPDATE 1
	
RYAN:
	- UPDATE 1
	
ROB:
	- JTable has been resized for convenience.
	- Layout has been re-arranged for convenience.
	- Menu and Order table more easily viewed together.
	- Communicator fully functional, reads menu and sends Table orders.

RAHUL:
	- The JTables for Orders and Inventory now update fill from the Database. They update every minute. So they call the database for the data every minute.
	-When the Order Ready button is clicked the Ingreidents for that menu Item are found. Then it subtracts from the Inventory based of the Ingredients and Quantity. It also changes the Current Status of that order in the TABLE_ORDER( database table) to 'READY'. Finally it calls functions to update the JTables for Inventory and Order.
	


	P.S.- I also get the employee Id that corresponds to that Order. Need help with notifications to push message to waiter.
	-Main problem is need help sending messages so I can complete the Send Message and Emergency functions.
