DAVID:
	- Recreated Host Interface to accomodate variable waiters

		  of tables
			>> To assign a waiter to a table:

				*Note: If a waiter already exists at a table, a popup will

	          already assigned to it, and unassigning customers from a table that 
		  already has customers at it (popup will come up showing error)
	
HARSH:
	- UPDATE 1
	
RYAN:
	- Added better interface between the text fields and the JTable. 
	- When you click or select a row in the JTable, the data generates in the corresponding
	- textfields in the Menu and Inventory windows. 
	- The goal behind this was to reduce the amount of typing between the user and the program.
	- This in turn reduces the amount of typing needed to edit items.
	- This also allows for easy item additions if there needs to be a new item added that 
	- is similar to one of the menu.
	
ROB:
	- UPDATE 1

RAHUL:
	- Made only one scroll view for the orders. 
	- Now can select the row for which item is ready.
	- Now the buttons for emergency has confirmation and message string input once it is clicked.
	- The send message asks for the message and the employee id.
	- The help button is now implemented.
	- NOTES:
		- The orders appear only on first initialization till the database is fully established
		- The communicator must be established before the send messages work.

RAHUL:
	- The JTables for Orders and Inventory now update fill from the Database. They update every minute. So they call the database for the data every minute.
	-When the Order Ready button is clicked the Ingreidents for that menu Item are found. Then it subtracts from the Inventory based of the Ingredients and Quantity. It also changes the Current Status of that order in the TABLE_ORDER( database table) to 'READY'. Finally it calls functions to update the JTables for Inventory and Order.
	P.S.- I also get the employee Id that corresponds to that Order. Need help with notifications to push message to waiter.
	-Main problem is need help sending messages so I can complete the Send Message and Emergency functions.
