					  status
		3) Available - change to this if the customer moves tables
		
	How to request a status change of a table:

		4) Select a new table status from the second drop-down menu
		5) Select the "Send Request to Host" button
		
	FAQ:
		Q) Why can't I request a status change for any table?
		A) Because each Waiter is assigned to specific tables. Let the 
		   Waiter who is assigned to that table take care of it
		   
		Q) I hit "Send Request to Host" but got an error pop-up. Why?
		A) There could be multiple reasons:
			1) You may not have one of the boxes selected

			3) In the event of case 2, call a System Administrator

	When would I use this?
		1) When you are delivering an order from the kitchen to the table

	When to use each order status:
		1) SERVED - When you complete a kitchen to customer delivery
		2) PAID - When a customer has completely paid for a table order

					  request of the customer

		6) Select the "Confirm" button
		
	FAQ:
		Q) I cannot change the status of an item. Why?
		A) If the order is in NOT READY status, it should not be changed.
		   If this is the case, that means the order is not out of the
		   kitchen yet and could not possibly have been served. The system
		   automatically prevents these type of errors
		   
		Q) I'm clicking confirm but getting an error pop-up. Why?
		A) Possible reasons:

			3) In the event of case 2, please contact your System Administrator
			
		Q) I am choosing a table, but the table is not populating. Why?
		A) This is because you have been assigned that table, but there are no
		   available table orders yet. Please wait for the customer to place
		   an order
